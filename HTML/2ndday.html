<h2 class="header1">An Eternal Love Story (Radha Krishna)</h2>
<p class ="para1">The Radha Krishna love story is eternal and sublime. It is symbolic of the divine union between the Jivatma and Paramatma â€“ the individual self and the universal self. The Bhagavata story of Krishna, the cowherd romancing Radha, the gopi is an incomparably superb mythology and a legend conquering times. Millions of people across generations are mesmerized by the Radha Krishna love story</p></div>

<h2 class="header3">Bhakti Yoga</h2>
<p class="para3">Jay Bagri says: "The idea of Radha Krishna as lovers is popular only after the Bhakti movement during the late medieval age. The poets and romantics have given this spiritual relation a physical form, and distorted the picture for the average viewers. In ancient prayers, "Rukmani, Satyabhama sametha Sri Krishnamasra" is what (is) recited and there is no mention of Radha altogether."</p>
